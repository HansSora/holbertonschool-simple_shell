# Simple Shell 

Simple Shell is project written using the C-programming language with the object of creating a basic version of a Unix shell able to intepret and execute commands provided by the use.



## Description

This **Simple Shell** can:

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command.
```shell
./hsh
$ ls
command_path.c shell.c string_utils.c README.md
$
```
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- If an executable cannot be found, prints an error message and displays the prompt again.
```shell
./hsh
$ hello
hello: Not found
$ 
```
- Handles errors.
- Handles the "end of file" condition (`Ctrl+D`)

Also works in interactive and non-interactive mode:
- interactive mode
```shell
./hsh
$ /bin/ls
AUTHORS README.md command_path.c shell.c shell.h
$
```
- non-interactive mode
```shell
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
AUTHORS README.md command_path.c shell.c shell.h
$
```

**Compiling**

The code can be compiled using **gcc** with additional attributes as follows. It produces an executable file named **hsh**.

## Code Structure

To develop the simple shell, we have built fundamental functionalities that allow to read a command provided by the user, process it, and execute it by referencing the respective Unix system call. To achieve such functionalities, as described in the figure below, our code relies on key functionalities related to 
1. manipulating string files 
2. accessing and displaying environment variables
3. accessing the full path of any Unix shell command
4. reading and executing any shell command.



provides an implementation of fundamental string functionalities such as :
	- `int _strlen(char *string)` - Finds the length of `string`
	- `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src)` - Concatenates content of `src` to the end of `dest`
	- `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src)` - Copies the content of `src` to `dest`
	- `char *_strdup(char *string)` - Duplicates a `string`
	- `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2)` - Compares `s1` with `s2`
	- `int _str_n_cmp(char *s1, char *s2, int n)` - Compares `s1` with `s2` regarding `n` bytes
- [environment_utils.c] - provides an implementation of key functionalities such as :
	- `char *_getenv(char *name)` - Function that searches for the environment `name`
	- `int _prinenv(void)` - Function that prints the environment `name`
- [command_path.c] - Finds the full path of the provided command
- [shell.c]- Logic implementation of our simple shell
	- `int command_read(char *s, size_t __attribute__((unused)) characters)` - Function that reads the `command` provided by `command_path()`
	- `int execute(char *cmd_array[])` - Function that takes an `command` and executes it
	- `int main(int __attribute__((unused)) argc, char *argv[])` - Entry point that executes every previously mentioned function

Feel free to use the code developed for the simple shell and get back to us with discussions on how to further improve it.
